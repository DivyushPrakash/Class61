        <p>Schwarzenegger was known as the Styrian Oak, or Austrian Oak, in the bodybuilding world, where he dwarfed his competition. He won his first amateur Mr. Universe title in 1967. After moving to California in 1968 to train and compete in bigger events in the United States, he won three more Mr. Universe titles and then the professional Mr. Olympia title six years in a row (1970–75) before retiring. He surprised the bodybuilding world by returning to competition one more time to claim the Mr. Olympia title in 1980. Bodybuilding was the subject of several of his books, including the autobiographical Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder (1977; written with Douglas Kent Hall) and The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (1998; written with Bill Dobbins
            Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger pursued his childhood dream of acting in movies. In his first film, Hercules in New York (1970), Schwarzenegger played the lead, but another actor was used to dub his dialog. Schwarzenegger’s native charm and wit finally came through in the acclaimed documentary Pumping Iron (1977), which led to his starring role in Conan the Barbarian (1982). He became an international star with The Terminator (1984) and over the next 20 years appeared in two sequels (1991 and 2003). His other films during this time included Predator (1987), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Total Recall (1990), True Lies (1994), and The 6th Day (2000).</p>
